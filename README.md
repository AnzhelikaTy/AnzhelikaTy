## Hi there 👋

### I'm Angelika Susemcik,
 ex-stewardess 🛫 and now a passionate self-taught **front-end web developer**. I decided to go further!
 
- 💪 My goal is to become **full-stack web developer** 

- 🎓 I started my journey in front-end development with SheCodes Worshops (Basics, Plus, Responsive) by Matt Delac

- 🖥️ I’m currently learning (diving deeper into JS) **'The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022'** by Colt Steele on Udemy (very excited about YelpCamp project!)

- ✏️ Great full-stack courses on Udemy such as **'MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js'** and **MERN eCommerce From Scratch** by Brad Traversy are in my **WISHLIST**!
