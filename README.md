## Hi there 👋

I'm Angelika Susemcik, ex-stewardess 🛫 and now a passionate self-taught front-end developer. 
I decided to go further, so currently my goal is to become full-stack 💪

- 🎓 I started my journey in front-end development with SheCodes Worshops (Basics, Plus, Responsive) by Matt Delac
- 🖥️ I’m currently learning (diving deeper into JS) **'The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022'** by Colt Steele on Udemy (really exited about YelpCamp project!)
- ✏️ I found more great full stack courses on Udemy such as **'MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js'** and **MERN eCommerce From Scratch** by Brad Traversy
